# Automatic dataset shift identification to support safe deployment of medical imaging AI

This repository contains the code associated with the paper [Automatic dataset shift identification to support safe deployment of medical imaging AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07940), accepted at **MICCAI 2025**.

## Overview
The code is divided into the following main folders:
* [classification](classification/) contains all the code related to training the task models as well as pre-training the self-supervised encoders. 
* [configs](configs/) contains all the experiment configurations for training the above models.
* [data_handling](data_handling) everything related to data loading (dataset, data modules, augmentations etc.)
* [shift_identification](shift_identification) contains all the necessary tools for dataset shift detection (BBSD tests, MMD tests) and identification (prevalence shift estimation, shift identification) 
* [experiments](experiments/) all the code related to experiments presented in the paper: inference code for each dataset group, shift generation code and plotting notebooks. 


## Important pre-requisites

### Step 1: Install all pip dependencies
All required python packages are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Please install with pip (this should take less than 5 minutes).

### Step 2: Data preparation

You will need to download the relevant datasets to run our code. 

#### Step 2.a.: Download datasets and update `default_paths.py`
All datasets are publicly available. For each dataset download the data from the below link, unzip, and update the path in `default_paths.py`:

| Dataset | Path to update in `default_paths.py` | Link |
|----------|----------|----------|
| PadChest    |  PADCHEST_ROOT   | [https://bimcv.cipf.es/bimcv-projects/padchest/](https://bimcv.cipf.es/bimcv-projects/padchest/)     | 
| RSNA Pneumonia    | DATA_DIR_RSNA    | [https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge)     | 
| NIH metadata csv | NIH_METADATA_CSV | [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data) > Data_Entry_2017.csv | 
NIH to RSNA mapping file | PATH_NIH_TO_RSNA_MAPPING | [https://s3.amazonaws.com/east1.public.rsna.org/AI/2018/pneumonia-challenge-dataset-mappings_2018.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/east1.public.rsna.org/AI/2018/pneumonia-challenge-dataset-mappings_2018.json) | 
| MESSIDOR-v2 dataset | MESSIDOR_ROOT | [https://www.adcis.net/en/third-party/messidor2/](https://www.adcis.net/en/third-party/messidor2/) | 
| Kaggle Aptos dataset | APTOS_ROOT | [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data) | 
| Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy | DIABETIC_ROOT | [https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data) | 
| EMBED | EMBED_ROOT | [https://github.com/Emory-HITI/EMBED_Open_Data/tree/main](https://github.com/Emory-HITI/EMBED_Open_Data/tree/main) | 

To facilitate the mapping between download and paths we have provided the corresponding download links for each path in the `default_paths.py` file as well. 

**IMPORTANT**: just download and unzip the datasets, do not modify the structure or the file names as the split generation files and dataset classes assume your folder follows the structure as per the downloaded datasets.

#### Step 2.b. Dataset csv preparation and splits generation
For every dataset we provide our train/test/split generation code to ensure reproducibility. Please **run all the notebooks** in [data_handling/preprocess_and_splits_creation](data_handling/preprocess_and_splits_creation/) to create and save the necessary splits csv **before running the code**.

For RSNA, you also need to run [data_handling/preprocess_and_splits_creation/rsna_preprocess_images.py](data_handling/preprocess_and_splits_creation/rsna_preprocess_images.py) to save the preprocessed images (224x224 pngs).

### Step 3: Download pre-trained encoders weights
In our paper, we test the capabilities of several pretrained encoders, readily available for download. Make sure you download the weights for the pre-trained SimCLR model trained on ImageNet from [https://github.com/AndrewAtanov/simclr-pytorch](https://github.com/AndrewAtanov/simclr-pytorch) and update PATH_TO_SIMCLR_IMAGENET in `default_paths.py`. Similarly download the RetFound model weight from [RetFound](ttps://github.com/rmaphoh/RETFound_MAE) and update the PATH_TO_RETFOUND.



## Main shift identification pipeline function
The main shift identification pipeline function can be found in [shift_identification_detection/shift_identification.py](shift_identification/shift_identification.py) in the `run_shift_identification` function.
This function runs one iteration shift identification/detection tests for a fixed reference and test set. A demo on how to use this function on some toy 2D dataset is provided in [shift_identification_detection/dummy_shift_identification_pipeline_demo.ipynb]([shift_identification_detection/dummy_shift_identification_pipeline_demo.ipynb]).

The function takes the following arguments:
```
Args:
   - task_output: output dict for task model. Should have two key 'val' and 'test' containing the results on the full validation (reference) and test sets. task_output['val'] should be a dictionary with at least a field 'y' with the ground truth, and 'probas' for the predicted probability by the task model. task_output['test'] should be a dictionary with a field 'probas' for the probability predicted by the model on the test set.
  - encoder_output: output dict for encoder. Should have two key 'val' and 'test' containing the results on the full validation (reference) and test sets. encoder_output[<split_name>] should be a dictionary with a key 'feats' containing the extracted features for each image in the set.
   - idx_shifted: which indices of the test split form sampled the target set. If the full test set should be considered as the test set, simply use np.arange(test_set_size).
   - val_idx: which indices of the val split should be used for the current reference set, if the full validation set should be used for the reference set, simply use np.arange(val_set_size).
   - num_classes: num classes in the task model, defaults to 2.
   - alpha: defaults to 0.05, significance level for the statistical tests.
```
 
## Shift identification - Workflow example to reproduce paper experiments
Here we detail the full workflow to reproduce all shift identification results for the mammography dataset. 
0. Set your PYTHONPATH to the root of the repository. `export PYTHONPATH={YOUR-REPO-ROOT}`
1. Train the task model with `python classification/train.py experiment=base_density`. This should only take a couple of hours to train (on a single GPU).
2. [Optional] Train the self-supervised encoder with `python classification/train.py experiment=simclr_embed`. This is optional, only if you want to reproduce the detection results with the SimCLR Modality Specific encoder. If you just want to run shift identification this is not necessary. It takes a couple of days to train.
4. Run inference and shift detection experiment with `python experiments/mammo_all.py --encoder_type={ENCODER} --shift={SHIFT}`. For each tested shift scenario, this script will save detection outputs for each bootstrap sample in a csv (one csv per shift). Running the identification experiments for all tested shifts should take a couple of hours (with 200 bootstrap samples). The arguments can take the following values:
    * `ENCODER` should specify which encoder to use for the MMD / Duo / shift identification test. It can take values:
        - `random` (random ResNet50 encoder)
        - `imagenet` (ResNet50 with ImageNet weights, supervised pretraining)
        - `simclr_imagenet` (ResNet50 SimCLR pretraining on ImageNet)
        - `simclr_modality_specific` (ResNet50 pretraining on the modality i.e. point 2)
        - `model` (encoder from classification task model). 
    * `SHIFT` can take values:
        - `prevalence`
        - `acquisition`
        - `gender`
        - `acquisition_prev`
        - `gender_prev`
        - `no_shift`
        - `all`. Defaults to `all`.
    
    
5. Plot the results with `plot_all_results.ipynb`
